This summer, with the support of SEO (Sponsors for Educational Opportunity), I am embarking on my open source journey. I began my journey by learning all about open source software by completing the "A Beginner's Guide to Open Source Software Development" course offered by the Linux Foundation. 

Open Source Software  means… “source code is made available with a license which provides rights to examine, modify and redistribute, without restriction on the user's identity or purpose ” I learned that open source does not necessarily mean free. There are many open souce softwares that you must pay to get access.
Open source development is valuable because it encourages collaboration among developers and encourages using the expertise of a diverse community. This collaborative environment nurtures more robust and secure software solutions. Open source makes software more reliable Because it allows people to look under the hood and see how the code works. The transparency encourages people to trust the code more. Open source software, also lowers the cost of development by eliminating the need for licensing fees. This encourages inclusivity in computer science by decreasing financial barriers.

Advantages of freely available source code include: 
  Cleaner code
  More secure code
  More input for ideas
  Faster bug repair 
  Speeds up overall development time

I learned that many resources I use frequently are actually open source projects. For example, the widely used operating system Linux, which powers a significant portion of the internet, is an open source project. Also, I use a macbook as my daily driver which run macOS. macOS is based on a BSD Unix kernel known as Darwin which is open-source. Aditionally, computer languages I have coded with like Ruby and Python are open source. 
The first thing I will be looking for as I begin searching for open source projects with be a project with educational value for children. Education has always been an area ive been Interested in. Both of my parents are elementary school, educators by profession, and naturallyI've inherited the desire to pour into the next generation. I am also interesting in finding gaming projects. I hope to find projects that can make a meaningful impact and I am exceted to begin my open source journey.
